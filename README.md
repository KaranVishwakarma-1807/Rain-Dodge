# Rain-Dodge

 This is the first game that I have created, while learning about Pygame module.

 It is a simple game where the player has to dodge the raindrops falling from the sky.
 The game ends when the player collides with a raindrop.

 In this game concepts like collision, rectangles, random number generation, window creation, game loop, event handling etc are used.

 Of couse I have took help from the official Pygame documentation and some online tutorials, that you can find on available online resouces.

I hope you'll also get to learn a lot from this game or it will atleast help you in some way.

Thank You!
Enjoy!
